<h1>Glossary</h1>
<dl class="glossary docutils">
<dt id="term-c">C</dt>
<dd>Programming Language originally created by Dennis Ritchie in 1972. One of the
most popular programming languages of all time, it is also one of
the most influential. C++, Java, Javascript, and Python all inherit
from the syntax, if not the style, of C. The most recent ISO standard
of C was released in 2011, and is often refered to as C11. Indisputably
the king of systems and embedded development, C is the primary language
used by OpenCTR projects.</dd>
<dt id="term-1">C++</dt>
<dd>Extension of <a class="reference internal" href="#term-c"><span class="xref std std-term">C</span></a> designed to add Object-Oriented features. Because
all valid C code is also valid C++, software compatible with both C and
C++ will often refer to both as C/C++. More widely known than C in
most mainstream development, C++ is not suitable for developing the
system level programming that makes up OpenCTR, due to its runtime
requirements, heavier overhead, and greater binary size. Still perfectly
okay to use C++ when developing your own applications though. An
object-oriented wrapper for libctr is forthcoming.</dd>
<dt id="term-citra">Citra</dt>
<dd><a class="reference external" href="http://citra-emu.org/">http://citra-emu.org/</a>.
Cross-platform Nintendo 3DS emulator (without stereoscopic 3D support though).
Written in Qt4.
More actively developed than <a class="reference internal" href="#term-dmoo"><span class="xref std std-term">3dmoo</span></a>.</dd>
<dt id="term-dmoo">3dmoo</dt>
<dd><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/plutooo/3dmoo">https://github.com/plutooo/3dmoo</a>.
Alternative to <a class="reference internal" href="#term-citra"><span class="xref std std-term">Citra</span></a>.
Less support for commercial games, but more hardware accurate emulation.</dd>
<dt id="term-dsx">3DSX</dt>
<dd>File format for Nintendo 3DS homebrew. Able to be executed on any
homebrew-enabled Nintendo 3DS console, as well as the <a class="reference internal" href="#term-citra"><span class="xref std std-term">Citra</span></a>
and <a class="reference internal" href="#term-dmoo"><span class="xref std std-term">3dmoo</span></a> emulators. For more information about 3DSX, see
<a class="reference external" href="http://3dbrew.org/wiki/3DSX_Format">http://3dbrew.org/wiki/3DSX_Format</a>.</dd>
<dt id="term-clang">Clang</dt>
<dd>A relative new-comer to the world of compilers, LLVM was originally
the Low Level Virtual Machine developed by Chris Lattner as a university
thesis project. Since then, LLVM has been backed by Apple and Google,
among others, and developed into a C/C++ compiler capable of rivaling
GCC. Having risen to the same heights that it took GCC 25 years to
reach in 7 years, LLVM/Clang support will be coming to OpenCTR soon.</dd>
<dt id="term-gcc">GCC</dt>
<dd>The GNU Compiler Collection (originally called the GNU C Compiler) has
been the defacto cross-compiler of choice for the past 20+ years.
Although GCC has faced competition in recent years, in the form of
<a class="reference internal" href="#term-clang"><span class="xref std std-term">Clang</span></a>, GCC remains the most powerful and versatile compiler for
many architectures and platforms. Hence its status as the default
cross-compiler for OpenCTR.</dd>
