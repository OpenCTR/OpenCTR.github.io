* Question: There's already devkitARM and ctrulib. Why did you guys feel the need to create OpenCTR?
* Answer: First, let us assure you that we harbor no hard feelings towards devkitARM, or ctrulib. We mention in ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS that devkitARM and ctrulib were of enormous influence in our own work. We envison OpenCTR becoming an alternative to the use of devkitARM and ctrulib, but not a replacement. OpenCTR simply has different goals and priorities from either project, not to say our goals and priorities are any better or worse than theirs. We also wanted to create a more unified project. devkitARM and ctrulib are developed separetely from each other. All OpenCTR projects share compatibility.
