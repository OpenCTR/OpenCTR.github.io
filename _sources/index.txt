OpenCTR

Free and Open Source SDK for the Nintendo 3DS.

========
Overview
========

The OpenCTR project is a community developed effort to develop a free and open-souce software development kit for developing homebrew software for the Nintendo 3DS. 

OpenCTR is itself an umbrella wrapper for several projects. Many of these sub-projects depend on another project, or else were specifically designed to integrate into an OpenCTR project. Because of these components interact with each other, it makes since to have specific functionality be a part of a separate but clearly defined OpenCTR sub-module. OpenCTR is not one monolithic project, but a collection of projects that form OpenCTR from the sum of all the sub-projects. To reflect the modularized nature of OpenCTR, this documentation is split into several groups.
