OpenCTR

Free and Open Source SDK for the Nintendo 3DS.

========
Overview
========

The OpenCTR project is a community developed effort to develop a free and open-souce software development kit for developing homebrew software for the Nintendo 3DS. 

OpenCTR is itself an umbrella wrapper for several projects. Many of these sub-projects depend on another project, or else were specifically designed to integrate into an OpenCTR project. Because of these components interact with each other, it makes since to have specific functionality be a part of a separate but clearly defined sub-module, with OpenCTR being, not mostly one project, but the sum of all of its sub projects.

Because OpenCTR is not intended to be a monolithic architecture, it makes sense that the documentation for it should similarly be separated into groups.
