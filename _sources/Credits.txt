List of people, events, abstract concepts, etc, that have enabled OpenCTR to come into existance.

This is a list of indirect contributors to OpenCTR. 
For a list of direct contributors, see :doc:`Authors`.


* `Smealum`_ - Indisputably the Grandfather (and `mentor`_) of the Nintendo 3DS Homebrew scene, none of OpenCTR would ever have been possible without his work.

* `Dave Murphy`_ - Developer of devkitARM and libnds - both are predecessors to much of the work in OpenCTR.

* `fincs`_ - For creating the 3DSX format (`according to smealum`_).

* `Binutils`_ - Assembler and Linker used by the OpenCTR toolchain.

* `GCC`_ - Optimizing C/C++ compiler used by the OpenCTR toolchain.

* `Newlib`_ - C Standard Library used in the OpenCTR toolchain.

* `LLVM`_/`Clang`_ - Next generation compiler suite. Intended to become a major part of OpenCTR in the future.

* `Dennis Ritchie`_ - The :strike:`God among men` man who developed the greatest programming language of all time: `C`_.

* :strike:`Nintendo - For providing a device worthy of the minds of eager developers and enthusiastic users, and for creating a culture of creativity-suppression that necessitated developers create a way to run homebrew themselves.`

* `3DBrew`_ - For leading the never-ending battle against :strike:`evil` ignorance, by documenting everything related to the Nintendo 3DS, from its hardware and vendor-supplied software, to the service API's, to recent news regarding the 3DS and its homebrew scene.
