Here is a list of all things you will gain by using OpenCTR:

* Cross-platform toolkit.
* Modern build system, powered by CMake.
* Option of using the traditional hosted GCC cross-compiler, or the new LLVM Clang cross-compiling target. 
* Heavily optimized backend, with compile and link-time optimizations enabled.
* Support from a friendly and helpful community.
* Opportunity to develop more than just games (over-priced games at that). OpenCTR provides developers with the tools to create all kinds of software, including games, utilities, media players, e-book readers, and so much more. The sky's the limit.
* Opportunity to learn about many new topics in programming, and about computers in general.
