Building OpenCTR from source
============================

This page is for users who wish to download and build OpenCTR from source. Normal users should download a pre-built binary at :doc:`Releases`.

=============
Prerequisites
=============

The following dependencies must be installed before building OpenCTR from source:
  + `CMake <http://www.cmake.org/>`__ - A cross-platform, open-source build system.
  + `Python <https://www.python.org/>`__ - A general-purpose, interpreted high-level programming language.
  + `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`__ - A python tool for generating beautiful documentation.
  + `Doxygen <http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/>`__ - The defacto tool for documenting C/C++ APIs.

---------------------
Optional Dependencies
---------------------

OpenCTR has the following optional, but not required, dependencies:
  + `Python <https://www.python.org/>`__ - A general-purpose, interpreted high-level programming language.
  + `Sphinx <http://sphinx-doc.org/>`__ - A python tool for generating beautiful documentation.
  + `Doxygen <http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/>`__ - The defacto tool for documenting C/C++ APIs.

--------
Compiler
--------

When building OpenCTR from downloaded source code, you will need to have a working C/C++ compiler installed. Naturally which compiler you need depends on which platform you are using:
  + Windows users need to download and install `MinGW <http://www.mingw.org/>`__ and `MSYS <http://www.mingw.org/wiki/msys>`__. Users who prefer not to use the command line may also install Visual C++ Express.
  + Mac OS X users should install XCode from the App Store (and preferabbly the command-line tools addon package).
  + Linux/BSD users just need to install the basic GCC suite (e.g. ``sudo apt-get install build-essential``)

========
Building
========

The latest release of OpenCTR can be found at :doc:`Releases`. Alternatively, the latest development source code can be cloned from the GitHub repository at `https://github.com/OpenCTR/OpenCTR <https://github.com/OpenCTR/OpenCTR>`__.

Even when building and installing OpenCTR from source, remember to follow the :ref:`post-setup` instructions.

When building from source, will install to the directory pointed to by **CTR_ROOT**, which must be set as either a CMake variable (e.g. ``-DCTR_ROOT=/opt/OpenCTR``) or as an environment variable. If **CTR\_ROOT** is not set, CMake will report an error configuring OpenCTR.

It is *strongly* recommended to build OpenCTR using the GNU Make or `Ninja <http://martine.github.io/ninja/>`__ generators. Using a Visual Studio or XCode generator is strongly discouraged, and any build failures are entirely the users responsibility.

After configuring, run ``make`` or ``ninja`` and wait. When we say "*this build takes a long time*\ ", we mean it could take several hours to finish.

=========
Packaging
=========

.. note:: This section is for package maintainers only.

OpenCTR binary and source packages are generated using CPack.

.. todo:: Currently only does TBZ2 and ZIP packages. NSIS and Mac PKGs are forthcoming.
